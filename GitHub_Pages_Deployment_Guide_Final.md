# Final Deployment Guide: Quick and Easy Tech Communication Hub Demo (Client-Only)

**Goal:** To successfully deploy the static client-only demo of the Communication Hub to your GitHub Pages repository. This guide addresses the previous blank page issues.

**Repository URL:** `https://quickandeasyapplications-sudo.github.io/communication-hub-demo/`
**Repository Name:** `communication-hub-demo`

## Prerequisites

1.  **Git**: Installed and configured on your local machine.
2.  **Node.js & pnpm**: Installed (Node.js 18+ recommended).
3.  **Local Repository**: You have cloned your `communication-hub-demo` repository locally.
4.  **Final Source Code**: You have the contents of the final package (`communication-hub-github-demo-client.zip`).

## Step 1: Prepare the Source Code

1.  **Replace Files**: Completely overwrite the contents of your local `communication-hub-demo` repository folder with the files from the final source code package.

2.  **Verify Base Path Configuration**:
    *   Open the `vite.config.js` file in your project root.
    *   **Crucially**, ensure the `base` property is set to your repository name:
        ```javascript
        // vite.config.js
        import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
        // ...
        export default defineConfig({
          base: '/communication-hub-demo/', // <-- MUST BE THIS VALUE
          // ...
        })
        ```
    *   *This step is vital and fixes the blank page issue by ensuring all assets are loaded from the correct subdirectory on GitHub Pages.*

## Step 2: Install Dependencies and Build

1.  **Open Terminal**: Navigate to your local repository directory.
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/communication-hub-demo
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Production Build**: This command compiles the application and creates the static files in a new `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```
    **Result**: A new folder named `dist` is created in your project root. This folder contains the final, deployable website.

## Step 3: Deploy using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

This method is the most reliable and automates the entire process.

1.  **Create Workflow File**:
    *   Create a new directory structure: `.github/workflows`.
    *   Create a file named `deploy.yml` inside the `workflows` directory.

2.  **Add Workflow Content**: Paste the following code into `deploy.yml`. This workflow will build your app and deploy the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
    name: Deploy Static Demo to GitHub Pages

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main # Trigger on push to the main branch
      workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger

    jobs:
      build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        
        steps:
          - name: Checkout 🛎️
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
          
          - name: Setup Node.js 🛠️
            uses: actions/setup-node@v4
            with:
              node-version: 20
              cache: 'pnpm'

          - name: Install Dependencies 📦
            run: pnpm install

          - name: Build Application 🏗️
            run: pnpm run build

          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages 🚀
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              publish_dir: ./dist # Deploy the contents of the 'dist' folder
              publish_branch: gh-pages # Push to the gh-pages branch
    ```

3.  **Commit and Push**: Commit the new workflow file and the built `dist` folder, then push to GitHub.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Final GitHub Pages demo package and automated deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```

4.  **Final GitHub Configuration**:
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on **Settings** -> **Pages**.
    *   Under "Source," ensure it is set to **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   Set the **Branch** to **`gh-pages`** and the folder to **`/ (root)`**.
    *   Click **Save**.

The GitHub Action will run, and after a few minutes, your final, enhanced, and debugged demo will be live at:
